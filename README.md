F-liter Semantics
===================

Various descriptions of the semantics of f-liter.

Language features
-----------------

Like f-lite but;

* Non-recursive local definitions.
* Applications to variables only.
* Desugared LHS.
* Not emit or emitInt but with seq.

Included variations
-------------------

So far, just;

* Locally nameless (in the style of "I am not a number, I am a free variable") in Haskell
